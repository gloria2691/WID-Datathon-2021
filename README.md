Datasets were downloaded from [widsdatathon2021/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/data)

# Description of scripts
The repository includes two workstreams, one for data cleaning,  explorative data analsyis and predictions (1 to 6) and one for data description, and more automated processing workflow using the [caret package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/vignettes/caret.html) in R.
Both workstreams use functions from the `functions.R` script and assume data is available from a download_dat folder within the repository (not version controlled).
